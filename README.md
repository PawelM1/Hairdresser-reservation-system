# Barber reservation System
The application was developed as part of the "Internet Technology" subject. Its task is to save the course of any league tournament. Its task is to book a visit to the barber.


It is a one-page website that allows you to make an appointment with a hairdresser, which can be changed to other similar reservations.

Possible booking hours are dynamically downloaded from the database using AJAX technology, after selecting the date.
In addition, the site uses basic technologies: HTML, JS, CSS, bootstrap, php version 7 and the MySql database.

A dashboard has also been created for viewing visits, filtering by date and generating a PDF based on the displayed table, for which jsPDF was used: https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF.
Login and password to dashboard are set in the database.
