The application uses the Payu gateway for payments, so if you want to use the booking system proposed by the site, you must configure this system in this folder. 
Of course, the application is not well secured, so do not use this project for commercial use :)

If you don't want to use this SDK, modify the make_pay functions in the finctions.php file
